## Enviroment
The map will be generated in a one line array that will be shown at the screen according to the size defined, map will be customizable .


## Mecanics
The game will be an RPG with dungeons, cities and NPCs (With AI if I have the time and patience), also the game will contain dialogue and quests, inventory and a combat system.

## The Art
As said before the game will be played fully in the terminal so the graphics will be ASCII characters, the following are some of the buildings/props created.

House
```
 _________
/_|_|_|_|_\
||_|___|_||
|___| |___|
```

Tree
```
 ,__ _,
/  ,\ ,\
\,__|,_/
  ||//  
 /__\  
```
 

Feel free to contribute if liked the idea :)
